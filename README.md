WIP

This provides an application, as well as the tooling around a single full-screen
application running on displays at [wip.bar](https://wip.bar/).

## Development setup
[Nix] is used to pin dependencies, and [Direnv] to enter a development
environment automatically.

[Install Nix](https://nixos.org/download/) and
[hook direnv into your shell][hook-direnv] to get started.
